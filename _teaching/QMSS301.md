I am working as a Graduate Student Instructor for QMSS 301 in the Fall 2024 semester.

QMSS 301: Quantative Social Science Analysis and Big Data, is offered by the QMSS program in School for Literature Science and Art at University of Michigan.

This course has 3 modules: Geospatial Analysis in R, Predictive Analysis in Python, and Sentiment Analysis & Web Scraping.

I am involved in conducting Weekly Lab sessions for over 30 students, conducting regular office hours and grading work.
