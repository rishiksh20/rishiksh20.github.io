My journey in data science began with a strong foundation in engineering, leading me to pursue a Master's in Data Science at the University of Michigan, where I will graduate in 2025. Over the past four years, I have honed my skills by solving intricate business problems for Fortune 100 clients in retail, telecom, and healthcare.

At Mu Sigma, I embraced the role of Data Science Manager, where I led talented teams to craft sophisticated models. One notable project involved creating an unbalanced multi-class classifier for network impairments, significantly reducing network outages for a Fortune-100 US-based Telecom giant. Another exciting venture was developing a clinical trial simulation tool using Bayesian Networks and Agent-Based Models, which brought new efficiencies to the healthcare domain. My strategic insights also played a crucial role in expanding Mu Sigmaâ€™s client portfolio.

Currently, I am channeling my passion for NLP and AI at the Language and Information Technologies Lab at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on detecting fake news and understanding user perception of news through advanced modeling with Large Language Models. This work not only fuels my curiosity but also sharpens my expertise in cutting-edge technologies.

I am deeply interested in AI/ML, NLP and GenAI. Driven by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and innovation, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and seizing opportunities to learn and grow. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate in the exciting world of AI.
