Hello! I’m Rishikesh Ajay Ksheersagar, a Data Scientist passionate about unraveling data complexities. Currently, I’m pursuing my [Master’s in Data Science](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/masters_students/mastersprograms/data-science-masters-program.html) at the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/). My journey began with a [Bachelor's in Computer Engineering](http://www.unipune.ac.in/dept/science/computer_science/default.htm) from [Savitribai Phule Pune University](http://www.unipune.ac.in/).

I spent four years at [Mu Sigma Inc.](https://www.mu-sigma.com), as a Data Scientist and later as a Data Science Manager, honing technical skills in AI/ML, Statistical Analyses, and Business Intelligence, and leadership, and mentorship qualities. Check out my [Work Experience](https://rishiksh20.github.io/work/).

My research at the [Language and Information Technologies Lab](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu), under [Dr. Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) and [Dr. Veronica Perez-Rosas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yatiIigAAAAJ&hl=en), focuses on NLP and GenAI, especially modeling fake news perception. Additionally, I contribute to the ["Climate Change, Demographic Shifts, and Socio-Political Stability"](https://cps.isr.umich.edu/project/minerva-climatechange/) project, analyzing data to identify causal relationships between climate change and social unrest. For more details, visit my [Research](https://rishiksh20.github.io/research/).

I am also working as a Graduate Student Instructor for [QMSS 301](https://lsa.umich.edu/qmss/minor-program/requirements-and-curriculum/qmss-301.html) course at University of Michigan, starting August 2024. For more details, visit my [Teaching](https://rishiksh20.github.io/teaching/).

I believe in the power of continuous learning and am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow. Let’s connect and explore data science together!
