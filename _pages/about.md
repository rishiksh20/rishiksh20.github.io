Hello! I’m Rishikesh Ajay Ksheersagar, a Data Scientist with a deep-rooted passion for unraveling the complexities of data. Currently, I’m pursuing my Master’s in Data Science at the [University of Michigan](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-programs/masters-in-data-science/), where I’m immersing myself in the latest advancements in AI and machine learning. My journey into the world of data started with a robust foundation in Computer Engineering, after completing my Bachelor's Degree from [Savitribai Phule Pune University](http://www.unipune.ac.in/dept/science/computer_science/default.htm), which laid the groundwork for my analytical and problem-solving skills.

I’ve had the privilege of working in diverse industries, including retail, telecom, and healthcare during my 4 year-long stint at [Mu Sigma](https://www.mu-sigma.com) from July 2019 to June 2023 as a Data Scientist and later as a Data Science Manager. I not only honed my technical skills but also developed a keen understanding of how data-driven decisions can transform businesses. One of the highlights of my career was leading a team to develop a multi-class classifier that significantly reduced network outages, showcasing the tangible impact of predictive modeling in directly improving people's lives.

My passion for data science extends into my academic research at the [Language and Information Technologies Lab](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu), where I focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI (GenAI) under the guidance of [Dr. Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) and [Dr. Veronica Perez-Rosas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yatiIigAAAAJ&hl=en). I find these fields incredibly fascinating due to their potential to revolutionize how we interact with information and technology. My current work involves detecting misinformation, an area I’m particularly passionate about given its critical importance in today’s digital age.

I believe in the power of continuous learning and am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow. Let’s connect and share our experiences in the fascinating world of data science. Whether you’re a fellow data enthusiast, a professional looking to leverage data for better decision-making, or someone curious about the potential of AI, I’d love to hear from you. Together, we can navigate the exciting and ever-evolving landscape of data and technology.
