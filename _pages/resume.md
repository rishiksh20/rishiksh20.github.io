## ACADEMIC PROJECTS

- **Efficient Reasoning LLM from Scratch (Apr 2025):** Built an end-to-end fine-tuning and quantization pipeline implementing LoRA and GPTQ manually using PyTorch. Fine-tuned
LLaMA 2 on GSM8K, achieving strong results using Chain-of-Thought (CoT), self-consistency sampling, and verifier-based reranking. Fully handcrafted training, quantization, and evaluation stack for efficient reasoning.  
  [GitHub](https://github.com/rishiksh20/efficient-reasoning-llm)

- **PapeRet (Sep - Dec 2024):** Research paper retrieval system (98k+ papers), LLaMA RAG-based summaries. MAP@10: 0.539, NDCG@10: 0.81.  
  [GitHub](https://github.com/nilaygautam2007/PapeRet) | [Report](https://github.com/nilaygautam2007/PapeRet/blob/main/PapeRet.pdf)

- **Register Augmented LLM Fine-Tuning (Oct - Dec 2024):** RegBERT for QA, enhancing context learning and interpretability. Evaluated with LRP and Integrated Gradients on TyDiQA.
