The "Climate Change, Demographic Shifts, and Socio-Political Stability" project at the University of Michigan investigates the impacts of climate and demographic changes on socio-political stability in Sub-Saharan Africa. By developing robust data infrastructure, empirical risk forecasting models, and innovative field data collection methods, the project aims to address pressing national security concerns related to these changes. More info [here](https://cps.isr.umich.edu/project/minerva-climatechange/).

As an NLP researcher in this project, my primary responsibility is to curate and analyze data to identify causal relationships between climate change and social unrest. This involves processing terabytes of data in form of Research Papers and Political Articles and using NLP algorithms to identify Cause-Effect pairs betwwen climate change phenomenon and social unrest parameters.

Through my work, I aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of how climate change influences social unrest, helping to inform strategies that can mitigate these impacts and enhance socio-political stability.
